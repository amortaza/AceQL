core
----
system defined default values in schema
!user defined default values in schema
!allow reference types
    remove x_mapping from x_importset
bootstrap x_schema
does x_choice match bootstrap?

gui
---
dictionary sort by name
fields in forms should be consistent ordering
make front end aware of field types
add "upload" to the list views
add "upload" to the form views
bsn gui delete table
why is schema GUI showing x_id twice?
list view, "1 of 0" is bad
rename "dictionary" -> "schema"
rename "tables" -> "view table data"
table label should be editable
id should not be editable in create form
refresh a form or page every so often?
